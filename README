The %{scl_name} package provides Scala 2.10.6 delivered as a Software
Collection. For more information about Software Collections, see the
scl(1) man page.

Installing the %{scl_name} Software Collection gets you Scala 2.10.6
with all required dependencies, including the Java Runtime Environment.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'scala'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications which
are not located in the file system root hierarchy but instead are stored in
an alternative location. The location is %{_scl_root} in
case of the %{scl_name} Software Collection.

Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express
common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way.
It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional
languages. It is also fully interoperable with Java.

When you want to start working with the %{scl_name} Software
Collection, use the scl utility to enable the scl environment.  See
the scl(1) man page for usage.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg from within the
  %{scl_name} Software Collection environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'scala'
  Run scala from the %{scl_name} Software Collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} Software Collection
  enabled.
